## Introduction
The thesis investigates the use of face recognition technology in surveillance systems. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these systems can be used to improve security and monitor public spaces effectively.

## Methodology
The project utilizes deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect and recognize faces in real-time. The methodology section covers:
- Data Collection: Gathering a diverse dataset of facial images.
- Preprocessing: Normalizing and augmenting the data.
- Model Training: Training the CNN model.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on test data.
