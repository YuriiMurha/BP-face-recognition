## Introduction
The thesis investigates the use of face recognition technology in surveillance systems. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these systems can be used to improve security and monitor public spaces effectively.

## Methodology
The project utilizes deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect and recognize faces in real-time. The methodology section covers:
- Data Collection: Gathering a diverse dataset of facial images.
- Preprocessing: Normalizing and augmenting the data.
- Model Training: Training the CNN model.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on test data.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YuriiMurha/BP-face-recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BP-face-recognition
    ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment (if created):
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (if applicable).

7. Run the main script to start the face recognition system:
    ```bash
    python ./src/main.py
    ```
